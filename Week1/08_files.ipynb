    "As astronomers, we deal with vast amounts of data, from telescope images to catalogs of millions of stars. This data is often stored in files, and it's essential to know how to read, write, and manipulate these files programmatically. Furthermore, errors are inevitable when working with data and code, and understanding how to handle them gracefully is crucial for writing robust and reliable astronomical software.\n",

    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Understand the concept of file I/O (input/output).\n",

    "*   Read data from files line by line or as a whole.\n",

    "## Opening Files in Python: A Beginner's Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, working with files is a fundamental task. Before you can read from or write to a file, you must first *open* it. Opening a file creates a connection between your Python program and the file on your computer's file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `open()` Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to opening files is the `open()` function. It takes two main arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`filename`:** The path to the file you want to open. This can be a relative path (relative to the current working directory) or an absolute path. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `\"my_data.txt\"` (relative path: in the same folder as your Python script)\n",
    "    *   `\"data/star_catalog.csv\"` (relative path: in a subfolder named \"data\")\n",
    "    *   `\"/home/user/documents/observational_data.fits\"` (absolute path: specifies the exact location on the system; *nix based systems example*)\n",
    "    *   `\"C:\\\\Users\\\\MyUser\\\\Documents\\\\data.txt\"` (absolute path on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`mode`:** A string that specifies how you want to use the file. The most common modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `\"r\"`: **Read mode**. Opens the file for reading. This is the default mode if you don't specify one. You can only read data from the file. If the file doesn't exist, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised.\n",
    "    *   `\"w\"`: **Write mode**. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its contents will be *overwritten* (all existing data will be lost!). If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. Use this mode with caution.\n",
    "    *   `\"a\"`: **Append mode**. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, new data will be added to the *end* of the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. This mode is useful for adding data to an existing file without erasing its contents.\n",
    "    *   `\"x\"`: **Exclusive Creation mode**. Creates a new file for writing. If the file already exists, it will raise a `FileExistsError`.\n",
    "    *   `\"b\"`: **Binary mode**. Opens the file in binary mode.\n",
    "    *   `\"t\"`: **Text mode**. Opens the file in text mode (default).\n",
    "    *   `\"+\"`: **Updating mode**. Opens the file for updating (reading and writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file_handle = open(\"star_catalog.txt\", \"r\") # Open the file in read mode\n",

    "2.  **File Conversion:** Write a program that reads star data from a file in one format (e.g., CSV) and converts it to another format (e.g., a fixed-width format). Handle potential errors such as missing data or invalid data types.\n",

    "3.  **Log File Analysis:** Write a program that reads a telescope log file and extracts information about observing sessions (start time, end time, target object). Handle potential errors in the log file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Web Scraping:** Use requests and beautifulsoup to obtain information. Handle Errors when no info about the desired target is found."

    "\n",
    "This notebook covered the essentials of file I/O and error handling in Python, providing you with the tools to read, write, and process data from files and manage potential errors gracefully. By mastering these concepts, you can build more robust and reliable astronomical software, capable of handling real-world data and unexpected situations. Remember to practice these techniques to solidify your understanding and explore more advanced error handling strategies as you continue your journey in astronomical programming."
