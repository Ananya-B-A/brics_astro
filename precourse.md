# Pre-Orientation: Data Analytics in Astronomy

Welcome, Astronomers! We're thrilled you'll be joining our **Data Analytics in Astronomy** training. This short guide provides essential information to help you prepare for the course and ensure you have a smooth start.

---

## 1. Course Introduction

This training is designed to equip you with the foundational Python programming skills necessary to tackle common tasks in astronomy. We'll move from the absolute basics of programming to applying Python concepts to analyze astronomical data, automate calculations, and understand how code can be a powerful tool in your scientific journey.

Our focus will be on practical application, using relatable examples drawn from astronomy wherever possible. We aim to create a supportive learning environment where questions are encouraged. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid base to build upon and the confidence to start using Python in your own astronomical projects.

## 2. Target Audience & Prerequisites

*   **Primary Audience:** Undergraduate students, researchers, or enthusiasts in astronomy (or related fields) who are **new to programming** or have very limited prior experience with Python.
*   **Programming Level:** **Beginner**. No prior programming knowledge is required. We will start from the ground up.
*   **Astronomy Level:** A basic interest or background in astronomy is helpful for understanding the examples, but advanced astronomical knowledge is **not** required.
*   **Technical Requirements:** Access to a computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux) with internet access and the ability to install software (see Section 4).

## 3. Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this training, you will be able to:

*   Understand fundamental programming concepts (variables, data types, operators).
*   Write and execute basic Python scripts.
*   Implement control flow using loops (`for`, `while`) and conditional statements (`if`, `else`).
*   Define and use functions to create reusable and modular code.

*   Read data from and write data to files.
*   Implement basic error handling using `try...except` blocks.
*   Import and utilize standard Python modules (like `math`, `time`).
*   Understand the concept of packages and install external packages (like `numpy`, `pandas`, `astropy` and other packages) using `pip` or `conda`.
*   Apply these Python concepts to solve simple problems relevant to astronomy.

## 4. Installation Guidelines: Setting Up Your Environment

To participate fully in the hands-on exercises, you must install the necessary software before the first session. We strongly recommend using the **Anaconda Distribution**, as it simplifies the installation of Python and many essential scientific packages.

**Steps:**

1.  **Download Anaconda:**
    *   Go to the official Anaconda Distribution download page: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/success](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
    *   Download the installer appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Choose the Python 3.x version (the latest is recommended).

2.  **Install Anaconda:**
    *   Locate the downloaded installer file.
    *   Double-click the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
    *   **Recommendation:** Unless you have a specific reason not to, we recommend accepting the default settings during installation. This usually includes adding Anaconda to your system's PATH environment variable (though the installer might advise against it for Windows, it often simplifies things for beginners – follow the installer's recommendation if unsure).

3.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   **Option A (Anaconda Navigator):** After installation, search for and open "Anaconda Navigator". This is a graphical interface. From Navigator, you should be able to launch "Jupyter Notebook". If Jupyter Notebook launches in your web browser, your installation is likely successful.
    *   **Option B (Terminal/Command Prompt):**
        *   Open your Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/Anaconda Prompt (Windows).
        *   Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see a Python version corresponding to the Anaconda installation (e.g., `Python 3.9.7`).
        *   Type `conda list anaconda$` and press Enter. This checks if the core Anaconda package is installed.
        *   Type `jupyter lab` and press Enter. This should launch Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.

4.  **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Installation issues are common, especially with path configurations.
    *   Refer to the official Anaconda documentation for detailed installation guides and troubleshooting tips: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
    *   If you encounter persistent problems, please reach out using the contact information provided in Section 6 before the first training session.

## 6. Pre-Course Preparation (Optional)

While not mandatory, you might find it helpful to:

*   Familiarize yourself with your computer's file system (how to create folders, find files).
*   Briefly browse a very basic Python tutorial online (e.g., the first few sections of the official Python tutorial at [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)) just to get a feel for the syntax, but don't worry if it doesn't all make sense – we will cover it!

## 7. Contact & Support (Pre-Course)

If you face difficulties with the software installation or have urgent questions before the training begins, please contact us at through the Slack channel.

Please try to resolve installation issues *before* the first session so we can dive right into the material.
